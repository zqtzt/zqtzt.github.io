I was glad to join the [OCEAN ICE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/euoceanice/) annual project meeting in Copenhagen from September 14-18. I was great to connect with new colleagues and share a presentation representing WP5 (Working Package 5; Task 5.1) about **the trends and variability of the South Atlantic upper ocean water mass in the past 45 years**. 

𝗢𝗖𝗘𝗔𝗡 𝗜𝗖𝗘 (Ocean-Cryosphere Exchanges in Antarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth System) is a Horizon Europe & UKRI-funded project that brings together an international team of researchers to 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗔𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗜𝗰𝗲 𝗦𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗲𝘁 through their influence on:

🌍 Global sea-level rise
🌊 Deep water formation
🌀 Ocean circulation
☀️ Climate impacts

🔎 The project combines 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 with 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, including coupled ice sheet–climate model development, to improve predictions of how changes in the 𝗔𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗲𝘁𝘀 affect global climate.

This week, the researchers have gathered at [Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut](https://www.linkedin.com/company/danmarks-meteorologiske-institut/) in Copenhagen to:
🤝 Share results and progress across the OCEAN ICE work packages
🌐 Reconnect with colleagues and meet new ones
🚀 Plan the next steps for this ambitious project
