I hold my Ph.D from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in July 2024.

**I sincerely thank my supervisors - Llijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu, for their guidance during my 5 years of Ph.D. study!!! They helped me a lot on my academic path!!**

During my Ph.D. study, I mainly focused on the study of ‘**climate impact-drivers**’ which connect physical ocean changes to broader climate change impacts. I used ocean climate observational and model data **to identify the climate change ‘hot spot’ regions mostly affected by the compound climate** changes and developed **frameworks** to assess these impacts. 

This includes first of the construction of high-quality ocean observational datasets with cutting-edge data processing techniques (e.g., data quality control, instrument bias correction, duplicate checking etc.). Then includes second about the investigation of the long-term change of compound climatic impact-drivers such as ocean temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the past decades.

**The title of my Ph.D. thesis is: *The construction of ocean in-situ observational database and the investigation of ocean compound climatic impact-drivers***



**I made a [vlog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MJt7MKJcsoef6b2fH7xPFg) (~15 minutes; in Chinese) to record my 'adventures' of the words, feel free to enjoy it!**
