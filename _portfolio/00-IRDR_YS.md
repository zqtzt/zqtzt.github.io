I am pleased to announce that I was successfully selected to be part of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) Young Scientists Programme (YSP).

The IRDR YSP is established to promote capacity building of young professionals, to encourage them to undertake innovative and needs-based research that improves DRR research, policy, and practice interactions, and to empower them to become future leaders in the global DRR community.

I am really lucky to be the Top-10 of 41 candidates. The project execution period is two years (2026-2028).

In this panel, I will contribute my knowledge of the compound climate risk from the ocean (e.g., warming, marine heatwaves, salinity changes, deoxygenation, acidification, tropical cyclones etc.), specifically focus on the climate risk in the exclusive economic zone (EEZs).
