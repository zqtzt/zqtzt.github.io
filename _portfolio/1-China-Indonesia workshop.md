On July 2024, A China-Indonesia Bilateral workshop of 'Ocean, Climate and Atmospheric Environment' was held at IAP/CAS.

I was very honoured to be one of the members of the organizing committee.

I also discussed some potential scientific collaborations of ocean data infrastructures and the ocean climate change adaptation.
