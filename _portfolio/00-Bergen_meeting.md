From September 21 to October 1, 2025, I served as a visiting researcher to visit [NORCE Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/norce/) and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research (BCCR) in Bergen, Norway.

I was very happy to discuss with one of my post-doc advisors -- (Elaine McDonagh)[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MOA44_QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao] -- on the topics on the **physical and biogeochmical changes in the South Atlantic water masses**. Also, I had the honor to meet with my colleagues [Xabier DÃ¡vila Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xabier-dÃ¡vila-rodriguez-4b2210155/) and [Petra Langebroek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-langebroek-b6106428/).

In these two weeks, I also shared:
ðŸŒŠ An invited talk at the BCCR seminar titled â€˜***Data-driven science: From Global Compound Ocean State Change to South Atlantic Water-Masses Responses***â€™. More than 20 researchers were presented.
ðŸŒŠ A poster titled '***Large-scale and deep-reaching compound ocean state change in a warming climate***' on the Bjerknes Annual Meeting (BAM) 2025.
