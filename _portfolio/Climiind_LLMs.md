**I engaged as a young scholar at Climind** ([https://www.climind.co/home/](https://www.climind.co/home/)) **involved developing methodologies to evaluate the robustness of Climind’s large languages models (LLMs) in disseminating climate knowledge from Feb 2024 to August 2024.** I engaged in the Industry research, climate database developing (e.g., assemble climate textual data), LLMs Prompt Developing, with particularly focusing on the creation of a benchmark dataset from the latest IPCC findings and external climate benchmark datasets to evaluate the model. This work highlighted my ability to integrate complex climate textual data with advanced AI technologies.

Below is my certificate of this project issued by Climnd:
