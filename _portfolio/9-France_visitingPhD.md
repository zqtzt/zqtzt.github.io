**From September 2022 to September 2023, I served as a visiting PhD student based in Mercator Ocean international based in Toulouse, France, advised by Karina von Schuckmann and Sabrina Speich (LMD/ENS).**

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Karina von Schuckmann for her invaluable help and support throughout my academic training. Her passion for ocean science is inspiring. We engaged in frequent discussions and participated in several international academic meetings or workshops, during which I gained knowledge and methodologies about scientific research from her. 

During this one years visiting in France, I experienced a lot of events, both academic and non-academic, which have benefited me throughout my life and future endeavors:

- Invited talk in LMD/ENS (Paris)
- Oral presentation in EGU23 (Vienna, Austra)
- Oral presentation in IUGG (Berlin, Germany)
- Participate in 2nd Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) meeting (Darmstadt, Germany)
- Outflow delegation for UNFCCC-COP27 (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt)
- Team building of Mercator Ocean International
- Tourism across many European countries (e.g., Chasing the Polar Light in Norway, etc.)
