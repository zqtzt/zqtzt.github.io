On November 11, 2022, The Chinese government organized a side event "Climate extremes: prediction and early warning" during the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([COP27](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop27)) in the China Pavilion.

The hybrid side event (both on-site and live streamed), organized by young scientists with the IAP, attracted more than 2000 viewers on the Internet.

How are climate extremes and climate change related? How evidence is found? How to predict? Three young IAP scientists answered these questions in their talks. Dr. WANG Jun first explained how anthropogenic greenhouse gases affect global climate and weather extreme events. Dr. WANG Jing presented TanSat—the first Chinese CO2 monitoring satellite—and how it monitors human-caused CO2 emission and concentration. Dr. ZHENG Weipeng introduced "EarthLab", an earth system numerical simulation facility developed in China and invited international communities to join the endeavor of improving the accuracy of weather and climate predictions for disaster prevention and mitigation.

Four IAP representatives, Dr YU Zipeng, **Dr TAN Zhetao**, Dr CHAI Zhaoyang and Ms. YANG Ying arrived in Egypt on November 7 and organized the on-site side event.

Dr. CHENG Lijing chaired the side event. After three talks, he played videos showcasing researches at IAP and calling for international collaboration. CHENG also invited Profs CAO Junji, ZHOU Tianjun, XU Xiyan and Viktor Gouretski to join the panel discussion. The panelists answered journalists' questions and shared their viewpoints on climate change related issues, including the importance of biodiversity, response of ocean to climate change, the role of climate internal variability, and the complicated effect of aerosols.

During the COP27, I also participated in 10+ side events and informal multilateral consultations on climate change, engaging with different experts on climate-related initiatives. Discussion topics include **climate risk management, climate action, just transition, oceanic climate change, ESG data-driven climate policy, and mitigation and adaptation**.
