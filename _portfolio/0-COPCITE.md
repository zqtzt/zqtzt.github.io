I’m proud to have co-organized a full-day COP simulation (COP@CITE simulation) on the 29th of March in the **Cité internationale universitaire de Paris** (CIUP). Celebrating 100 years of CIUP and 10 years of the Paris Agreements, this event was a great opportunity to engage youth in discussions about environmental policies and reflect on current challenges. 💪

Participants connected with people who have attended COPs, learned about how these events function and the important role youth play. We then held roundtable discussions on several pressing topics:
🐋 Biodiversity and the Ocean 
⚡️ Energy Transition
🏦 Climate Finance & Justice
📚 Climate Education

I brought my expertise in the ocean&climate change to the roundtable with the presentation title of 'Ocean warming and its impacts on marine ecosystems'. 

Let’s keep amplifying young voices in the fight for a sustainable future! 💚
