Changes in the global ocean salinity reflect the evolution of the global hydrological cycle. These secular changes are assessed using seawater salinity profiles obtained during the past ~80 years. Here, A new study recently published in *Scientific Data*  introduces a new global ocean salinity profiles database named CODC-S (the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) Oceanography Data Center – Salinity component), which encompasses over 11 million in-situ salinity profiles from 1940 to 2023 obtained by means of several instrument types. These salinity profiles are quality-controlled (QC-ed) using a new automated salinity quality control system named CODC-QC-S (the CODC Quality Control system – Salinity component), consisting of 11 distinct quality checks. By applying time-varying, flow-dependent, and topographical-dependent 0.5% and 99.5% quantile thresholds, the CODC-QC-S defines local climatology salinity ranges without the assumption of Gaussian distribution. The CODC-S database, together with the newly proposed QC algorithm, has undergone extensive evaluations, including comparisons with the benchmark data and climatology, as well as analyses of global and basin-scale long-term salinity changes before and after QC. These validations demonstrate that the quality of salinity data in the CODC-S is time-, depth-, region- and instrument type-dependent. 

This eight-decade quality-homogeneous salinity profiles dataset can support diverse oceanographic and climatic research such as monitoring water cycle changes and freshwater/overturning transports.
